<p>
    This application is build with modularized modular monolith design with part of the code provided via a NuGet package. 
    The concepts shown by this application are:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The application design uses the modularized modular monolith design as described in
            <a href="#">this section of the first article</a> in the evolving modular monoliths series.
        </li>
        <li>
            A large part of this application has been removed and placed in a
            <a href="https://github.com/JonPSmith/BookApp.Books">separate solution called BookApp.Books</a>
            to make it easier to develop on its own.
            It is then turned into a NuGet package and fed in to the BookApp.Main.FrontEnd project, as described in
            <a href="#">the second article</a>.
        </li>
    </ul>

    This application was first built for the <a href="https://bit.ly/EfCoreBook2">Entity Framework Core in Action, second edition</a> book.
    It as been improved to provide a better modular monolith design.
