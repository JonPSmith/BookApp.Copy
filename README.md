# BookApp.Main

This is a version of the BookApp used in the evolving modular monoliths series (!!! link !!!). The BookApp is a e-commerce web app build around ASP.NET Core and EF Core. This application features in my book [Entity Framework Core in Action](https://bit.ly/EfCoreBook2).

This specific version:

- Contains BookApp UI (front-end), the `Orders` bounded context code and, the `BookApp.Books` NuGet package (!!! link !!!).
- Uses the modularize bounded context approach (!!! link !!!), where each project is focused on one job.
